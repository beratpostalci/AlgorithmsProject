I implemented insertionSort, quickSort and modified version of quickSort algorithms to measure running time of them with different cases.
There are 4 automated tests (A1-A2-B1-B2) for measuring running time: 

A1 --> input size = 4095, input type = random integers
A2 --> input size = 32737, input type = random integers
B1 --> input size = 4095, input type = integers with decreasing order
B2 --> input size = 32737, input type = integers with decreasing order

My system specs provided in systemSpecs.txt
My system's test results in Table.ods
